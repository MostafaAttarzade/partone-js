var x = 7;
x = x % 3 ;
// Answer : value for x is 1 !

console.log("this is simple math operations");
console.log( x += 5);
// answer is six beacuse pervious x is one 1 !
console.log(x %= 2);
// now value for x is zero right? that's call also even number!

/*learn simple operations math is but maybe remainder kind of tricky
but you will learn by time */
